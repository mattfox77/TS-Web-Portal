We discussed 3 goals:
Comparing 2 estimates for differences (Levelr has similar functionality)
Converting Estimates into Xactimate (ClaimsFlow offers similar)
Evaluating estimates and recommending improvements - line items, rate and fee maximization and reliable pricing  (Xactimate Application insights is similar)

Ill start researching these goals and provide more information. 
We will need to identify example documents for testing functionality 
I will see what examples I can find online. 

Can you provide an example of 2 different estimates for a project, an Xactimate Estimate export, and an example of an estimate that has been converted to Xactimate, including the before and after (Xactimate export vs Report)

Talk to you soon!
Matt
